### FAQ

1. Why is the name of this database called "MAYE SQL"

During the pandemic (2020), I tried to challenge myself by creating a simple relational database. I decided on the name "BRADY_SQL". Why? Because he is the greatest football player to ever play. This is a follow up project now tht I have much more experience programming and I've researched many types of databases and their internals so I thought it appropriate to stat from scratch.

Drake Maye is currently the QB for the Patriots (at least as of 2026), so it seems fitting the sequal to my work would be named after him.
